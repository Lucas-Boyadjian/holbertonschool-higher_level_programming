# Python More Classes

This repository contains exercises and scripts related to advanced usage of classes in Python, created as part of Holberton School projects.

## What are "More Classes"?

This section goes beyond basic class definitions and covers advanced object-oriented programming concepts in Python, such as:
- Special methods (`__str__`, `__repr__`, etc.)
- Operator overloading
- Class and static methods
- Property decorators (`@property`)
- Encapsulation and data hiding
- Comparing objects

## Project Structure

Each file in this directory demonstrates or practices a concept related to advanced Python classes.

## Topics Covered

- Defining and using special methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__del__`, etc.)
- Counting instances of a class
- Comparing objects with rich comparison methods
- Using class attributes and static methods
- Using and defining properties with getters and setters

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Run any script with Python 3:
   ```
   python3 <script_name.py>
   ```
3. Read the code and comments to understand advanced class features in Python.

## Requirements

- Basic knowledge of Python and classes
- Python 3.x installed on your system
