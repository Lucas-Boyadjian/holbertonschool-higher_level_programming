# Python Data Structures

This repository contains exercises and scripts related to Python data structures, created as part of Holberton School projects.

## What are Data Structures?

**Data structures** are ways to store and organize data in a program so it can be used efficiently.  
Python provides several built-in data structures, including lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

## Project Structure

Each file in this directory demonstrates or practices a concept related to Python data structures.

## Topics Covered

- Lists: creation, indexing, slicing, and methods
- Tuples: immutability and tuple operations
- Sets: uniqueness and set operations
- Dictionaries: key-value pairs and dictionary methods
- Iterating over data structures
- Basic algorithms using data structures

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Run any script with Python 3:
   ```
   python3 <script_name.py>
   ```
3. Read the code and comments to understand how each data structure works in Python.

## Requirements

- Basic knowledge of Python
- Python 3.x installed on your system
