# Python Serialization

This repository contains exercises and scripts related to serialization in Python, created as part of Holberton School projects.

## What is Serialization?

**Serialization** is the process of converting a Python object into a format that can be easily stored (in a file or database) or transmitted (over a network).  
Deserialization is the reverse process: converting the stored or transmitted data back into a Python object.

Common serialization formats in Python include **JSON**, **pickle**, and **CSV**.

## Project Structure

Each file in this directory demonstrates or practices a concept related to Python serialization.

```

## Topics Covered

- Serializing and deserializing Python objects with JSON (`json` module)
- Using pickle for binary serialization
- Saving and loading objects to and from files
- Understanding the difference between serialization formats

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Run any script with Python 3:
   ```
   python3 <script_name.py>
   ```
3. Read the code and comments to understand how serialization works in Python.

## Requirements

- Basic knowledge of Python
- Python 3.x installed on your system
