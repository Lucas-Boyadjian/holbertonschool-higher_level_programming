# Python More Data Structures

This repository contains exercises and scripts related to advanced data structures in Python, created as part of Holberton School projects.

## What are "More Data Structures"?

This section covers advanced usage of Python's built-in data structures, such as sets and dictionaries, as well as more complex operations on lists and tuples.  
You will learn how to manipulate, combine, and process data efficiently using these structures.

## Project Structure
