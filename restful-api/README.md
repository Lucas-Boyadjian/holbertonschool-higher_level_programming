# RESTful API

This repository contains exercises and scripts related to building and consuming RESTful APIs in Python, as part of Holberton School projects.

## What is a RESTful API?

A **RESTful API** (Representational State Transfer) is a web service that uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to allow clients to interact with resources (data) in a stateless manner. RESTful APIs are widely used for web and mobile applications to communicate with servers.

## Project Structure

Each file in this directory demonstrates or practices a concept related to RESTful APIs.

```

├── 2-post_resource.py
├── 3-put_resource.py
├── 4-delete_resource.py
├── ... (other scripts)
└── README.md
```

## Topics Covered

- Building a simple RESTful API using Python (e.g., with Flask or FastAPI)
- Handling HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Consuming APIs using Python (requests module)
- Working with JSON data
- Understanding status codes and error handling

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. For API server scripts, run with Python 3:
   ```
   python3 <script_name.py>
   ```
3. For client scripts, make sure the API server is running, then run the client script.
4. Read the code and comments to understand how RESTful APIs work in Python.

## Requirements

- Basic knowledge of Python and HTTP
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- [Optional] Flask, FastAPI, or requests module (install with `pip install flask fastapi requests`)
