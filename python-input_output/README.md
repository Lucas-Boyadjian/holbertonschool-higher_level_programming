# Python Input/Output

This repository contains exercises and scripts related to input and output operations in Python, created as part of Holberton School projects.

## What is Input/Output in Python?

**Input/Output (I/O)** in Python refers to reading from and writing to files, as well as handling standard input and output.  
Common I/O operations include opening files, reading/writing data, and working with file paths.
